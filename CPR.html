    <h2>CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation):</h2>
    <p>CPR is a vital life-saving technique used when someone's heartbeat or breathing has stopped. It involves a combination of chest compressions and rescue breaths to maintain blood circulation and oxygenation of vital organs until professional medical help arrives. Proper training in CPR equips individuals with the skills and confidence to respond effectively during emergencies, potentially saving lives in their communities.</p>

    <p>Video simulation training offers a dynamic and interactive way to learn and practice CPR techniques. These simulations replicate real-life scenarios, providing participants with a realistic environment to hone their skills. By immersing learners in lifelike situations, video simulations enhance training effectiveness and prepare individuals to respond confidently and decisively during emergencies.</p>

<!-- Choking Section -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>Choking and Rescue Techniques:</h2>
    <p>Choking occurs when a foreign object obstructs the airway, leading to difficulty breathing. Prompt intervention is crucial to prevent asphyxiation. The Heimlich maneuver, back blows, and chest thrusts are common techniques used to dislodge the obstruction and restore airflow. Recognizing the signs of choking and knowing how to administer these techniques can make a significant difference in saving someone's life.</p>

  <h2>Bee Sting Treatment:</h2>
  Treating a bee sting promptly is crucial to alleviate discomfort and minimize the risk of complications. The following steps outline how to effectively treat a bee sting:

Firstly, remove the stinger promptly if it's embedded in the skin. Use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card, or another flat object to scrape it out, avoiding squeezing the stinger to prevent the release of more venom.

Next, wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and water to reduce the risk of infection. Gently pat the area dry with a clean cloth afterward.

Applying a cold compress or ice pack wrapped in a cloth to the sting site can help reduce swelling and numb the area. Apply the cold compress for about 10-15 minutes at a time, several times a day.

Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be taken to alleviate pain and discomfort. It's essential to follow the dosage instructions on the packaging.

If the area is itchy or irritated, applying calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream can help soothe the skin.

In cases where the sting is on an extremity like the hand or foot, elevating the affected area can aid in reducing swelling.

Monitor the sting site for any signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face or throat. If severe symptoms occur, seek medical attention immediately.

Individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions to bee stings or those experiencing symptoms like difficulty breathing or a rapid heartbeat should seek medical attention promptly. Emergency treatment, such as an epinephrine injection, may be necessary.

Lastly, it's crucial to keep an eye on the sting site for signs of infection, such as increasing pain, redness, warmth, or pus. If infection is suspected, consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.
